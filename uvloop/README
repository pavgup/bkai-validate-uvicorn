This directory contains a Dockerfile and build script for building
the uvloop Python library that has been patched with the uvloop.patch
file. The patch modifies the uvloop library to use a pipe instead of
a Linux eventfd for eventing. (The pipe code is used on non-Linux
unix systems that don't have eventfds. The patch changes some
#ifdefs in the code so when building for Linux, the non-Linux
code is used).

The build.sh script will create the docker image, run it to build
the python package, and copy the built python package outside of
the build container.

The .whl file can be installed by copying it into a container and
running `pip` with the path to the .whl file.
